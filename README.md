## 1. What is a Bang?

Citing DuckDuckGo, who first introduced them back in 2008:
> **Bangs are shortcuts that quickly take you to search results on other
> sites.** For example, when you know you want to search on another site like
> Wikipedia or Amazon, our bangs get you there fastest. A search for [`!w filter
> bubble`](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!w+filter+bubble) will take you directly to
> Wikipedia.

<br>

## 2. How does the extension work?

Simply install the extension and use any of the supported [Kagi
Bangs](https://kbe.smaertness.net/). If you prefer
[DuckDuckGo Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs), you
can change them in the settings. You can of course also add your
custom bangs!

<br>

Bangs can be used at the beginning or at the end of the query, e.g.:

```console
!gm here to closest restaurant
```

is equivalent to

```console
here to closest restaurant !gm
```

<br>

Bangs can also be triggered without any query, serving as a bookmark shortcut:

```console
!weather
```

## 5. FAQs

<details>
  <summary><b>Do bangs sync across devices?</b></summary>
  <p>Yes... and no. Bangs will sync across all the Firefox <i>desktop</i> browsers in which you are logged in with your Firefox account. However, the sync between desktop and mobile is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1625257">currently unsupported</a>. As a workaround, you can create a backup on desktop and restore it on Android (or vice versa).</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why does Yang need permissions on a 300+ sites?</b></summary>
  <p>Instead of requesting data access on <i>all</i> sites, we granularly
  specify the search-engine sites that Yang supports (which yeah, they're quite
  a few). You can find which sites we request permissions for in the
  <a href="https://github.com/dmlls/yang/blob/main/manifest.json">
  <code>manifest.json</code></a>.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Does Yang collect any data?</b></summary>
  <p>Yang does not collect any kind of data and never ever will!</p>
